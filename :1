# Continuous Delivery Playground
My playground for setting up a continuous delivery pipeline with Docker.

- Jenkins
- GitLab
- Using a simple Dropwizard microservice as an example application
- Using a Docker image (containing the microservice) to create reproducible environments for all stages of the continuous delivery pipeline.

# Step by Step Tutorial
